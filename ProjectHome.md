This is the source code for Compastic! a lightweight compass application available on the Android Market at https://market.android.com/details?id=com.metaaps.mobile.compastic&feature=search_result

It has no intention of being a commercially viable product, just a nice idea I wanted to implement.

I am not saying the code is optimal, nor is it a reference (yekkk no) or bug free! It was made on my spare time for a bit of fun and I am releasing it with the hope that parts could be useful to someone.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know. I can also take criticism quite well ;-). I know it's far from perfect!
